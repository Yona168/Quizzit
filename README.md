#### Quizzit
Simple application to make & take quizzes

### Installation
I do need to figure out deployment at some point. For now (temporarily), 
clone the repo and build in IntelliJ.

Also be sure to put the path to where you want your quizzes to be stored in config.json. I should make a default
option, that's a TODO.
