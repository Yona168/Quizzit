#### Quizzit
Simple application to make & take quizzes

### Installation
Download the .exe installer from the releases page

### Mechanics
Quizzit stores quizzes in the filesystem (perhaps in the future there will be more options, but not yet).
You will be able to find quizzes at "Users/{you}/.Quizzit"

### Usage
The home GUI provides two buttons - one to create a new quiz, and one to view all quizzes.
From the latter, you can delete quizzes, edit them, or take them.

I believe the actual usage is pretty intuitive, so enjoy
